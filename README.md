# CS-210-Programming-Languages

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is an app that helps to speculate how much interest will effect your principle. It also takes into account the possibility of regular deposits over a year to see how that also effects the end number of a bank. By taking in the required values it then prints out the breakdown and shows the final amount after a set period of time.

## What did you do particularly well?
I think I did 2 things particularly well. I think my prompt was well done and easy to understand, even though this is probably the easiest thing to do it is super important because it is the part of the program that interacts with the user. I also think that my workflow in the code is well done and is easy to understand for someone who is looking at the code at a later date.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I definetely could break my code up in to classes better to make it more modular. I could also do this to make it more DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and that woudl make it more effecient code. Finally I could have used try cases to catch runtime errors.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The interest part my the hardest to do for me. I think this is because of the nested loops to get the number. The number I kept getting was huge and obviously wrong. I was able to make some adjustments by breaking it down one loop at a time with printouts to the console to see what was happening with the number then by seeing what was happening I was able to adjust the workflow to get a closer number. I think the biggest helpful thing was using Visual Studio as the ability to debug with a proper IDE made it possible to see what is happening with the variables.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think the biggest thing that is transferable from this project to another project would be the concept of a simple program that is actually viable to use. This could be used in other situations besides a banking app. Most larger applications are really when you break it down many small applications that work together to do something.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Some things I used to make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable is using clear and specific variable names so you know exactly what is being stored in that value and hopefully why. Also using comments where applicable. One thing I could have done that I did not but wish I did, is explain why I did something when I made changes during debugging because if I look at it in the future I might not remember why I made a variable start at 1 instead of 0 or other out of the ordinary setups that are needed to make it work.
